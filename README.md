# Surfs Up Statistical Analysis

data analysis of weather for investors of surf shop: utilizing SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code,  and Python

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

We are proposing a business venture to open a surf and shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. To help determine the risk for potential investors, an analysis has been prepared on historical weather in Hawaii from 2010 - 2017. The statistical analysis is focused specifically on temperatures in June and December over this time period. Focusing on June and December will help determine if the shop will be sustainable year-end based on changing weather conditions through the year.


The following analysis was performed based off of weather data captured in the Hawaii SQLite database file located here:
