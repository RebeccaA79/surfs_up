# Surfs Up Statistical Analysis

## Overview:

We are proposing a business venture to open a surf and shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. To help determine the risk for potential investors, an analysis has been prepared on historical weather in Hawaii from 2010 - 2017. The statistical analysis is focused specifically on temperatures in June and December over this time period. Focusing on June and December will help determine if the shop will be sustainable year-long based on changing weather conditions through the year.


The following analysis was performed based off of weather data captured in the Hawaii SQLite database file located here:

## Results:

Based on the statistical analysis for June and December reflected in the images below, the following highlights are noted:

1. The mean temperature for June at 74.9, is 3.9 degrees higher than the mean temperature for December. Higher June temperatures are anticipated; however this difference is not so large to suggest having a significant impact on business.

2. The minimum temperatures shown have a larger difference: June at 64 versus December at 56. While a temperature of 56 would disway most people from venturing out for some surfing and ice cream, the data must be evaluated as a whole. 56 is the lowest point in the dataset, however reviewing some of the other statistical information indicates this is most likley an outlier.

3. Comparing the percentile categories and maximum temperatures between June and December, there is only a two to four degree difference. This is another indication that the temperatures remain relatively moderate in Hawaii with only a small decline in the winter.

## Summary:

Overall the temperatures in Hawaii appear to be moderate and relatively consistent through the year. This makes Oahu an ideal place to open a surf and ice cream shop. Natives and tourists will be able to enjoy the excellent surfing year-round while indulging in some amazing ice cream.
